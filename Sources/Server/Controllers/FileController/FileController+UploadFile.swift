Plus, I'm running into locking problems if I have the lock here. My hypothesis is: The Upload somehow acquires a lock that is needed by the DoneUploads. While the Upload is "uploading" its file, the DoneUploads acquires the GET_LOCK but is blocked on the other lock that the Upload has. The Upload tries to get the GET_LOCK once it finishes its upload, but can't since the DoneUploads has it. The Upload times out on its GET_LOCK request and fails. The DoneUploads completes, having gotten the lock that the Upload had.

/* [1]
I'm getting another deadlock situation. It's happening on a DoneUploads, and a deletion from the Upload table. I'm thinking it has to do with an interaction with an Upload.

What happens if:

a) An upload occurs for sharing group X.
b) While the upload is uploading, a DoneUploads for sharing group X occurs.

sharingGroupUUID's are a foreign key. I'm assuming that inserting into Upload for sharing group X causes some kind of lock based on that sharing group X value. When the DoneUploads tries to delete from Upload, for that same sharing group, it gets a conflict.

Conclusion: To deal with this, I'm (1) not adding the record to the Upload table until *after* the upload, and (2) only doing that when I am holding the sharing group lock.
